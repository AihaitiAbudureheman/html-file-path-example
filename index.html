            1.I have a folder on my Desktop called Test, and this HTML file id inside that Test folder
            2.I have another folder called image-folder inside my Downloads folder
            3.And inside that Downloads folder, I have an image called box.png
            4.In order to link to that box.png file from my HTML file which is
              located inside the Test folder on my Desktop
            5.I need to use the absolute file path starting from system's root folder
              like below
            6.Check the instructions below for how I got this file path:
        -->
        <img src="C:\Users\baghr\Downloads\image-folder\box.png" alt="Box Image" />
        <!--
            Instructions<For Windows> You can also watch the attached video called Instructions.mp4:
            1.Right Click your image or video file, then select <Properties>
            2.After that take the value of the Location Property, the value of Location
              property is the Folder path, in my case it is this part:
              <C:\Users\baghr\Downloads\image-folder>
            3.Add back slash and your file name with extension at the end of the folder path,
              in my case, it will be like this:
              <C:\Users\baghr\Downloads\image-folder\box.png>
            4.And assign this full path to the src attribute, like the above example.
